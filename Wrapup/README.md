Wrapup Lab
=========

Introduction
------------


This folder has two scripts, checkMe.sh and checkWrapup.sh. The checkMe.sh is 
called from the evaluatLabs_Wrapup.sh (handling multiple submissions), and the 
checkWrapup.sh is called when evaluating a single submitted archive. 

To test your submission you should use the checkWrapup.sh, as it checks that 
the archive name is correct, then unpacks and calls checkMe.sh to test the
submission. 

For details,
    checkMe.sh see README_checkMe.md
    checkWrapup.sh see README_checkWrapup.md
